## Recent Projects

- 🚀 Void Music: I led the development of a Discord bot for music streaming as part of Allure Void Studios. The bot, developed using Java and Python, allowed users to play songs, create playlists, and share music with friends using voice commands and text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. The speech recognition component of the bot was implemented using Python, while the main functionality was built using Java. I worked alongside Jacobwasbeast, a team member at Allure Void Studios, to implement additional features. Technologies used: Java, Python, and Discord API.

- 📈 AVS Discord Management Bot: I developed a Discord management bot for Allure Void Studios using JavaScript and the Discord.JS library. The bot, built using Node.JS, allowed users to manage channels, assign roles, and automate tasks. I implemented features such as custom commands and integration with popular task management tools to make it easier for the team to collaborate and stay organized. Technologies used: JavaScript, Discord.JS, and Node.JS.
